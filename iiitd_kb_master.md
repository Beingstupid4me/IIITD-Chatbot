## 3.4. Academic Rules and Regulations (The "Law")
*(High Retrieval Importance: Users frequently ask "What happens if I fail?" or "What is the attendance rule?")*

### 3.4.1. The Grading System
*   **Type:** Relative Grading (for large classes) / Absolute Grading (for small classes, at instructor discretion).
*   **Grade Points:**
    *   **A:** 10 (Outstanding)
    *   **A-:** 9 (Excellent)
    *   **B:** 8 (Very Good)
    *   **B-:** 7 (Good)
    *   **C:** 6 (Average)
    *   **C-:** 5 (Below Average)
    *   **D:** 4 (Marginal)
    *   **F:** 0 (Fail - Course must be repeated)
    *   **I:** Incomplete (Due to medical/extraordinary reasons; must be converted to a grade within weeks).
    *   **X:** 0 (Academic Dishonesty/Plagiarism Penalty).
    *   **S/X:** Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (used for 2-credit courses like SG/CW).
*   **SGPA vs CGPA:**
    *   **SGPA:** Semester Grade Point Average.
    *   **CGPA:** Cumulative Grade Point Average (Weighted average of all semesters).

### 3.4.2. Attendance Policy (Strict)
*   **Rule:** 100% attendance is expected. **75% is mandatory** to appear for the End-Semester Examination.
*   **Waiver:** Medical leave or "On Duty" (OD) leave (for sports/competitions) can lower the threshold, but typically not below 60% (Subject to DoAA approval).
*   **Penalty:**
    *   If attendance is < 75% but > 60% (approx): Usually a **Grade Drop** (e.g., A becomes A-).
    *   If attendance is critically low: The student may be awarded an **'F' grade** or debarred from the exam.

*   **Policy:** IIITD has a **Zero Tolerance Policy**.
*   **Scope:** Applies to Code Assignments, Lab Reports, Quizzes, and Exams.
*   **MOSS:** The institute uses MOSS (Measure Of Software Similarity) to detect code copying.
*   **Consequences:**
    *   **First Offense:** Often results in '0' marks for the assignment + a Warning.
    *   **Serious/Repeated Offense:** Award of **'X' Grade** (Fail with disciplinary remark) in the course. The 'X' grade remains on the transcript and affects future opportunities (TA-ship, Placements).
    *   **DAC:** Disciplinary Action Committee hearings for severe cases.

### 3.4.4. Add/Drop and Withdrawal
*   **Add/Drop Period:** Usually the first 2 weeks of the semester. Students can add or remove courses without transcript entry.
*   **Late Drop (Withdrawal):** Allowed up to a specific date (e.g., post-Midsem).
    *   *Effect:* The course appears on the transcript with a **'W'** tag. It does not affect SGPA, but 'W' counts indicate dropped attempts.
*   **Audit:** Students can audit a course (attend without grade). It appears as 'Audit' on the transcript if requirements are met.

### 3.4.5. Probation and Termination
*   **Academic Warning:** If SGPA < 4.5 (or specific threshold) in a semester.
*   **Probation:** Continued poor performance. The student is assigned a Faculty Mentor.
*   **Termination:** A student may be terminated from the program if:
    *   CGPA falls below the minimum required (e.g., 4.5 or 5.0) for consecutive semesters.
    *   Failure to complete the degree within the maximum duration (6 years for B.Tech).
